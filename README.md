"Vine on Loop" 
12/2017, by Caleb Blackwell for Thinkful Capstone project #1.

This is a Vine dupe site. Vine was a popular social media video posting site up until 2017 when it was discontinued. Users would make 7 second videos referencing pop culture, and these videos, in turn became pop culture for an entire generation.

Using this site, Vines play on loop using a youtube API. Just press play to unleash the magic. The interface also incorporates GIPHY API to allow users to search for gifs based on the vines they're watching.

The site was originally outlined with a social media API involved, to link up with the viners you're watching using twitter, or instagram. But both of those APIs proved to be unreliable for this project. 

Wireframe can be seen below, as well as a screen shot of the title page, and the gif area.
